# Python For Tester
- Here is the repository to guide the lessons from basic level to advanced level as Python For Tester/QA/QC.

# Setup local environment - Python Installation
- Install Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/
You should select the proper installation version for your operation types (Windows, MacOSX, Linux)
- How to configure multiple Python versions in your local environment.
#TBD

- Configure Python Virtual environment in your workspace
On all my tutorials, I suggest you follow my steps to set up the virtual environment instead of using the base python environment.

```
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Check whether python was installed on your computer or NOT.
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.12
$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
```
