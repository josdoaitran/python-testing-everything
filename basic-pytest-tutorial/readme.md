Here are some essential lessons to get started with pytest:
1. Installation and Setup

Install pytest using pip: pip install pytest
Create test files with names starting or ending with "test"
Run tests by simply typing pytest in your project directory

python# test_example.py
def test_simple():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
2. Writing Basic Tests

Create functions that start with "test_"
Use Python's assert statement for validations
Keep tests focused on one specific behavior

pythondef test_string_methods():
    text = "hello"
    assert text.upper() == "HELLO"
    assert text.capitalize() == "Hello"
3. Test Discovery

Pytest automatically finds tests in current directory and subdirectories
Tests must follow naming conventions: test_*.py or *_test.py
Test functions must be named test_*

4. Simple Fixtures

Use fixtures to set up test preconditions
Return values from fixtures to use in tests
Fixtures help eliminate repetitive setup code

pythonimport pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_sum(sample_data):
    assert sum(sample_data) == 15
## 5. Basic Parametrization

Run the same test with different inputs
Clearly specify expected outputs for each input
Reduce code duplication for similar test cases

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [
    ("3+5", 8),
    ("2+4", 6),
    ("6+9", 15),
])
def test_eval(test_input, expected):
    assert eval(test_input) == expected
```

## Running Tests
pytest has many command line options with a powerful discovery mechanism:
```
python -m pytest
# To discover and run all tests from the current directory

python -m pytest -v 
# To explicitly print the result of each test as it is run

python -m pytest tests/test_calc_func.py 
# To run only the math function tests

python -m pytest tests/test_calc_class.py 
# To run only the Calculator class tests

python -m pytest --junitxml=results.xml 
# To generate a JUnit-style XML test report

python -m pytest -h 
# for command line help
```

It is also possible to run pytest directly with the "pytest" or "py.test" command, instead of using the longer "python -m pytest" module form. However, the shorter command does not append the current directory path to PYTHONPATH.
