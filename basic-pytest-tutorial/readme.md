## Running Tests
pytest has many command line options with a powerful discovery mechanism:

python -m pytest to discover and run all tests from the current directory

python -m pytest -v to explicitly print the result of each test as it is run

python -m pytest tests/test_calc_func.py to run only the math function tests

python -m pytest tests/test_calc_class.py to run only the Calculator class tests

python -m pytest --junitxml=results.xml to generate a JUnit-style XML test report

python -m pytest -h for command line help

It is also possible to run pytest directly with the "pytest" or "py.test" command, instead of using the longer "python -m pytest" module form. However, the shorter command does not append the current directory path to PYTHONPATH.
